# R U Healthy & Co. - AI Health Prediction App

A super modern, fun, and stylish health prediction web app powered by machine learning! ✨

## Features

- **Modern UI**: Glassmorphism design with smooth animations
- **AI Powered**: Real logistic regression model trained on health data
- **Fun & Interactive**: Emojis, jokes, and personality throughout
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant health status predictions

## What It Predicts

The AI analyzes your:
- ☕ Coffee consumption habits
- 😴 Sleep patterns and quality
- 🏃‍♂️ Physical activity levels
- 📊 Health metrics (BMI, heart rate)
- 🚬 Lifestyle choices (smoking, alcohol)
- 😰 Stress levels

And predicts your health status: **Good**, **Mild Issues**, or **Severe Issues**

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Easy Start (Recommended)
```bash
python start_server.py
```
This will automatically install dependencies and start the server!

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Flask server
python app.py
```

Then open your browser to: `http://localhost:5000`

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── html.html              # Main frontend (super modern UI)
├── styles.css             # Stylish CSS with animations
├── app.py                 # Flask backend with ML model
├── start_server.py        # Easy startup script
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── synthetic_coffee_health_10000.csv  # Training data from KAGGLE
└── LogisticRegression_Health_classifier.ipynb  # Original model made by D Hillman
```

## How It Works

1. **Data Processing**: The app uses the original CSV data to train a logistic regression model, the target is Health status
2. **Feature Engineering**: Categorical variables are one-hot encoded
3. **Real-time Prediction**: User input is processed and fed to the trained model
4. **Fun Results**: Predictions are displayed with emojis, confidence scores, and health tips

## UI Features

- **Glassmorphism Design**: Modern frosted glass effects
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Interactive Elements**: Custom radio buttons and form validation
- **Fun Personality**: Jokes and emojis throughout the experience

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **ML Model**: Scikit-learn Logistic Regression
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS Grid and Flexbox

## 📊 Model Performance

The model is trained on 10,000 synthetic health records and achieves good accuracy in predicting health issues based on certain lifestyle factors.

## 🎉 Facts

The app calculates statistics like:
- How many times your heart beats per day
- Your annual caffeine consumption
